# Sculk Redstone Components
Adds Sculk Redstone components: Retainer, Shrieker, &amp; Calibrator

This mod adds 3 new Sculk-themed Redstone Components which are the:
1. **Redstone Retainer** - This block will store & output the first Redstone signal strength sent to it, only resetting when receiving a signal to it's side input. If the input is sent through a mono-stable circuit to the side, the Retainer can be updated on-the-fly.
   - Crafted with 3 Stone, 2 Redstone, & 1 Sculk
2. **Redstone Shrieker** - By default, this block will "shriek" the Frequency it received as an input Redstone signal strength (e.g. input Redstone signal strength 1 will trigger a `resonate_1`), which can be used for wireless redstone transmission. Alternatively, powering the side input before inputting a signal will make it audibly shriek, just like a Sculk Shrieker!
   - Crafted with 3 Stone, 2 Redstone, & 1 Sculk Shrieker
3. **Redstone Calibrator** - This block will only output a signal if the input signal strength is equal to the side signal strength (or strength 1 by default), which makes Redcoders extremely simple!
   - Crafted with 3 Stone, 2 Redstone, 1 Sculk, & 1 Amethyst Shard
